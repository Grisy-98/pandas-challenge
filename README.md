# pandas-challenge

This challenge has me analyze school data for a certain district by looking over each of their students's standardized test results for math and reading. Additionally, I had access to information of each school in that district, specifically, the type of school, the student's grade level, and the school's budget.

From the given data, we can see that in this district, there are 39,170 students that come from 15 different schools and the overall budget is $24,649,428.00. Out of those 15 schools, only 8 schools are charter schools while the rest are district. The average math score is about a 78.99, which is lower than the average reading score, which is 81.88. Approximate 75% of the students passed math while approximately 89% of the students passed reading. About 65% of the students passed both math and reeading.

Looking at each school specifically, Bailey High School has the most amount of students as well as the greatest budget, while Holden High School has the least amount of students as well as the smallest budget. Cabera High School has the highest percent of overall passing students, but Pena High School has the highest percent of students passing math, while Thomas High School has the highest percent of students passing reading.

After looking over the data, a conlusion that can be made is that charter school have a much higher percentage, almost more than 36%, of students passing overall. 

Additionally, the less money spent per student, the overall percentage of students passing increases.
